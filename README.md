### Running this Software

* Run the server from the dungeonwall directory with 'npm run start'
* Run 'npm run sass' in the dungeonwall/frontend directory to make sure styles are up to date.
* Run the front-end from the dungeonwall/frontend directory with 'npm run start'
* Navigate to localhost:8080 to view the frontend. If everything went well, you should have the demo panels loaded.
* There's a seedDB file you can run with 'npm run seed' to create a new wall with panels. **This is broken right now; working on a solution.**
